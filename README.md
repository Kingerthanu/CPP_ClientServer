User Can Launch The Program In Multiple Modes; One Of These Being A Server Mode In Which Will Establish A Accepting Socket For Clients To Request From. The Other Modes Are Client-Side And Work On Reads Of A Given File Path, Checks On The File Path, Deletion Of A Given File Path, As Well As STDIO Reads And Then Writes To The Server Through A Byte Stream.

**The Breakdown:**

Program Works With A Terminal In Order To Do Transactions Amongst A Host And Clients On File Directories Concurrently Through Multithreading.

The Program Starts By Calling It With An Attached Mode In Which Will Specifify The Specific Pipeline This Process Will Run Through.

There Will Be 1 Main Mode That Must Be Active In Order For The Others To Properly Work In Which Is The Server; The Server Will Arbitraily Ping A Port In Which To Bind The Processes' To, Creating A Socket And Printing It. This Socket Will Work To Listen For A Incoming Request From A Client In Which Wants To Do A Transaction. The Server When Hearing A Connection Through Its Listen(...) Will Then Wait Until The Client Provides A Byte Stream Of The Given Mode And Its Size. With This Mode The
